## 📌 Overview

DebugPilot AI is a lightweight AI-powered debugging assistant designed for developers working with modern full-stack applications.

Developers often lose significant time manually reading logs, tracing stack errors, and identifying the actual subsystem responsible for failures. DebugPilot AI transforms raw logs, runtime exceptions, deployment failures, and API errors into structured debugging reports with actionable engineering insights.

The goal of the project is not to replace developers, but to accelerate the first triage pass by converting noisy debugging data into a clean workflow-oriented report.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

Debugging production and development issues usually starts with scattered context:

* Stack traces
* CI/CD failures
* Browser console errors
* Runtime exceptions
* API response failures
* Authentication issues
* Infrastructure logs

Most debugging workflows are repetitive and unstructured. Developers spend time:

* identifying the subsystem
* estimating severity
* finding root causes
* determining immediate next steps
* deciding what to check first

This slows engineering velocity and increases debugging fatigue.

---

## ✅ Solution

DebugPilot AI provides a structured debugging workflow that converts raw technical failures into practical engineering reports.

The application analyzes developer input and generates:

* Error categorization
* Severity classification
* Likely subsystem detection
* Root cause analysis
* Immediate next debugging step
* Suggested fixes
* Debugging checklists
* Prevention guidance
* Confidence scoring

Instead of returning long generic AI responses, the app focuses on concise, engineering-oriented outputs that resemble real incident triage workflows.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend

* Next.js 14
* TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS

### UI/UX

* Glassmorphism-inspired interface
* Responsive layout
* Animated report transitions
* Loading shimmer states

### AI Workflow

* Structured debugging pipeline
* Heuristic fallback analyzer
* Confidence scoring system
* Workflow-oriented response generation

---

## 🧱 Architecture

The application uses a lightweight Next.js API route as the analysis boundary.

If an AI API key is configured, the system can generate structured debugging responses using an LLM. If no key is configured, the app falls back to a local heuristic analyzer to ensure the application remains fully functional during demos and local development.

This approach keeps the application:

* lightweight
* reliable
* demo-friendly
* deployment-safe

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yashyr190/debugpilot-ai.git
```

### Navigate into the project

```bash
cd debugpilot-ai
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```
